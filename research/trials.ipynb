It is \\nthe number one cause of blindness in people between the ages of 20 -64 in the United States. It is, therefore, a \\nworthwhile topic for all medical students to review. Diabetes mellitus is extremely common, so it is not surprising \\nthat DR affects 3.4 percent of the population (4.1 million individuals). Of the millions of people with DR, nearly \\none-fourth have vision-threatening disease (AAO 2008). \\nThe likelihood of developing diabetic retinopathy is related \\nto the duration of the disease. Type 2 diabetes has an insidious \\nonset and can go unnoticed for years. As a result, patients may \\nalready have DR at the time of diagnosis. Type 1 diabetics, on \\nthe other hand, are diagnosed early in the course of their \\ndisease, and they typically do not develop retinopathy until \\nyears after the diagnosis is made. The risk of developing \\nretinopathy increases after puberty. Twenty years after the \\ndiagnosis of diabetes, 80% of type 2 diabetics and nearly all \\ntype 1 diabetics show some signs of retinopathy (Klein 1984a, \\nKlein 1984b). \\nWhile these numbers are eye-opening, diabetics can \\ndecrease their risk of retinopathy and slow the progression of \\nthe disease after it has begun with tight glucose control \\n(DCCTRG 1993). Glucose control also has the added benefit of \\ndecreasing risk for other end-organ complications of diabetes, \\nso it is important that diabetic patients are educated on the \\ntopic. Time since diagnosis and extent of hyperglycemia are the \\nmost significant risk factors for the DR, but other risk factors for \\ndevelopment and progression include hypertension, \\ndyslipidemia, smoking, nephropathy, and pregnancy (AAO \\n2008). \\nANATOMY \\nThe retina is a multi-layered sheet composed of neurons, \\nphotoreceptors, and support cells. It is one of the most \\nmetabolically active organs in the body, and as a result, it is \\nextremely sensitive to ischemia and nutrient imbalances (Frank \\n2004). A perfused retina is a happy retina.  \\nNormal Fundus \\n \\nDiagram of Normal Eye'),\n",

The inner two-thirds of the retina is supplied by branches of the central retinal \\nartery, which comes from the ophthalmic artery (the first branch off of the internal carotid artery.  \\nThe central retinal artery exits out of the optic nerve, and its branches arch temporally both above and below \\nthe macula (the sensitive region of the retina responsible for central vision).   \\nAlthough the exact pathophysiology of diabetic microvascular disease is unknown, hyperglycemia is thought to \\ncause endothelial damage, selective loss of pericytes, and basement membrane thickening, all of which contribute \\nto leaky, incompetent blood vessels \\nNormal OCT \\n \\nCLASSIFICATION \\nDiabetic retinopathy falls into two main classes: nonproliferative and proliferative. The word “proliferative” \\nrefers to whether or not there is neovascularization (abnormal blood vessel growth) in the retinaEarly  disease \\nwithout neovascularization is called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR).  As the disease progresses, it may \\nevolve into proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), which is defined by the presence of neovascularization and has \\na greater potential for serious visual consequences.'),\n",

This weakens the capillary walls and results in \\nsmall outpouchings of the vessel lumens, known as \\nmicroaneurysms. Microaneurysms eventually rupture to \\nform hemorrhages deep within the retina, confined by \\nthe internal limiting membrane (ILM). Because of their \\ndot-like appearance, they are called “dot-and-blot” \\nhemorrhages. The weakened vessels also become leaky, \\ncausing fluid to seep into the retina. Fluid deposition \\nunder the macula, or macular edema, interferes with the \\nmacula’s normal function and is a common cause of \\nvision loss in those with DR. Resolution of fluid lakes can \\nleave behind sediment, similar to a receding river after a \\nflood. This sediment is composed of lipid byproducts and \\nappears as waxy, yellow deposits called hard exudates. As \\nNPDR progresses, the affected vessels eventually become \\nobstructed. This obstruction may cause infarction of the nerve fiber layer, resulting in fluffy, white patches called \\ncotton wool spots (CWS). \\nNPDR IS FURTHER  SUBDIVIDED BASED ON RETINAL FINDINGS : \\nEarly NPDR – At least one microaneurysm present on retinal exam. \\nModerate NPDR – Characterized by multiple microaneurysms, dot-and-blot hemorrhages, venous \\nbeading, and/or cotton wool spots. \\nSevere NPDR – In the most severe stage of NPDR, you will find cotton wool spots, venous beading, and \\nsevere intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA). It is diagnosed using the “4-2-1 rule.” A diagnosis \\nis made if the patient has any of the following: diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and microaneurysms in4 \\nquadrants, venous beading in ≥2 quadrants, or IRMA in ≥1 quadrant. Within one year, 52-75% of patients \\nfalling into this category will progress to PDR (Aiello 2003). \\nPDR – As mentioned earlier, the retina has a high \\nmetabolic requirement, so with continued ischemia, \\nretinal cells respond by releasing angiogenic signals such \\nas vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Angiogenic \\nfactors, like VEGF, stimulate growth of new retinal blood \\nvessels to bypass the damaged vessels. This is referred to \\nas neovascularization. In PDR, the fibrovascular \\nproliferation extends beyond the ILM. This may sound like \\na good idea, but the new vessels are leaky, fragile, and \\noften misdirected. They may even grow off the retina and \\ninto the vitreous. As the vitreous shrinks with age, it pulls \\non these fragile vessels and can cause them to tear, \\nresulting in a vitreous hemorrhage and sudden vision loss. \\nThese vessels may also scar down, forming strong anchors \\nbetween the retina and vitreous causing traction on the \\nretina. If enough force is created, a tractional retinal \\nNonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) \\n \\nProliferative Diabetic Retinopathy'),\n",

This is another mechanism by which DR can cause sudden vision loss.  If the retina is not re-\\nattached soon, especially if the macula is involved, vision may be permanently compromised.   \\nWhile the effects of neovascularization in PDR can be devastating, the most common cause of vision loss in \\ndiabetics is macular edema. Macular edema can occur in NPDR, but it is more common in more severe cases of DR \\ndue to the leakiness of the new blood vessels (Wani 2003). \\nDiabetics can also have problems located more anteriorly in the eye. The angiogenic molecules that are \\nproduced by the retina may float anteriorly, causing neovascularization of the iris. These vessels can grow into the \\nangle of the anterior chamber where the trabecular meshwork, the drain  of the eye, resides. This can obstruct \\noutflow of aqueous fluid, raising intraocular pressure and causing acute glaucoma.  \\nSYMPTOMS \\nPatients usually do not experience symptoms until late in the course of the disease when treatment may be \\nineffective. Late symptoms of DR vary depending on the cause. Bleeding into the vitreous can cause sudden loss of \\nvision. Macular edema and ischemia are two other mechanisms of decreased vision.  \\nSCREENING  \\nScreening for DR is incredibly important since most patients do not experience any symptoms until advanced \\nstages of disease. If recognized early, the vision-threatening side-effects of DR can often be prevented with \\nappropriate management. Recommendations for screening are different for type 1 and type 2 diabetics.  Because \\nmany patients with type 2 diabetes have retinopathy at the time their diabetes is diagnosed, it is recommended \\nthat their annual dilated eye exams begin shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes is made.  Type 1 diabetics should \\nbegin annual eye exams 3-5 years after their diabetes diagnosis (AAO 2008). \\nDR can progress rapidly during pregnancy. Pregnant women with diabetes should have a dilated eye exam \\nprior to conception, early in the first trimester, and then every 3 months until delivery.  Unlike pre-existing \\ndiabetes, gestational diabetes does not place patients at increased risk of DR and these patients do not require \\nfrequent eye examinations (AAO 2008). \\nEXAMINATION \\nA proper diabetic eye exam should always begin by gathering a thorough history from the patient.  Ask about \\nany visual symptoms and systemic issues which may impact their risk for DR such as pregnancy, blood pressure, \\ncholesterol levels, and renal status. Additionally, make sure to check their last hemoglobin A1c to gain an idea how \\ntheir blood glucose control has been over the past 3 months. (AAO 2008) \\nExamination should begin with visual acuity, intraocular pressure measurements, and a slit -lamp exam, \\nincluding careful inspection of the iris for neovascularization. If neovascularization of the iris is suspected or the \\npatient has elevated intraocular pressures, gonioscopy should be performed to assess the iridocorneal \\nangle. Gonioscopy utilizes a special mirrored lens which allows you to view the angle and trabecular \\nmeshwork. This cannot be accomplished using the slit lamp alone. Next, the patient should have his or her pupils \\ndilated for a thorough fundus exam.'),\n",

The best treatment for DR is prevention \\nof its development and progression with tight glucose control (DCCTRG 1993).  Patients should maintain a HbA1c \\n≤7%. Blood pressure management has also been shown to decrease disease progression (UKPDSG 1998) and \\npatients should be counseled to stop smoking. Ophthalmologists should intervene if the patient has clinically \\nsignificant macular edema (CSME) with NPDR. The causative microaneurysms are localized, often using fluorescein \\nangiography, and then directly treated with laser therapy. If the leakage is more diffuse, a grid of light laser burns \\ncan slow the edema. Finally, several off-label medical options are available, such as intravitreous injections of \\ntriamcinolone and antibodies against VEGF such as Lucentis® or Avastin®.   \\nOnce a patient has developed PDR, there are several treatment modalities available. Treating macular edema \\nin PDR is similar to treating NPDR. PDR, however, also has additional therapy options aimed at taming the growth \\nof new, problematic vessels. The mainstay of treatment is panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), in which portions of \\nretina are destroyed using thousands of laser burns while sparing the macula.  It is hypothesized that this may \\nreduce the amount of ischemic retina, and thus, reduce the production of angiogenic molecules.  The treatment \\nmay sound extreme, but actually causes surprisingly little vision loss (Frank 1975).  It has been found to be \\nextremely effective, reducing the risk of severe vision loss by 50% (ETDRS 1987, Mohamed 2007) and resulting in \\nregression of neovascularization in 30-55% of patients (DRS 1981, “Photocoagulation treatment” 1978).  \\nPatients with non-resolving vitreous hemorrhages or severe traction causing retinal detachment may benefit \\nfrom a vitrectomy. In this procedure, the vitreous gel and hemorrhage are removed from the eye and replaced \\nwith a saline solution. \\nSURGERY INDICATIONS  \\nPRP is advised for patients with vitreous hemorrhage and \\nareas of neovascularization or in patients with large amounts \\nof neovascularization of the optic nerve. It can also be \\nconsidered in patients with severe NPDR to prevent \\nprogression to PDR. \\nMacular edema should be treated once it becomes \\nclinically significant. CSME is diagnosed if the patient has at \\nleast one of the following criteria (Friedman 2009): \\n• Retinal thickening within 500 μm of the fovea \\n• Hard exudates within 500 μm of the fovea with \\nadjacent thickening \\n• Retinal thickening ≥1500 μm in diameter within 1500 μm of the fovea \\nThe optic disc measures 1500 μm in diameter on average and can be used to estimate distances along the \\nretina. \\nVitrectomy should be performed when a vitreous hemorrhage fails to resolve after 6 months or after 1 month \\nin type 1 diabetics (Meredith 1998). The procedure is also indicated for certain tractional retinal detachments. \\n  \\nPanretinal photocoagulation (PRP)'),\n",

During an \\nFA, a fluorescent dye is injected intravenously and a special \\ncamera takes fundus photos over several minutes while the \\nvessels are being perfused.

As many people with type 1 diabetes suffer blindness \\nas those with the more common type 2 disease. Diabetic retinopathy occurs \\nin more than half of the people who develop diabetes. \\nCauses: The primary cause of diabetic retinopathy is diabetes—a condition in \\nwhich the levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood are too high. Elevated sugar \\nlevels from diabetes can damage the small blood vessels that nourish the  \\nretina and may, in some cases, block them completely.  \\n When damaged blood vessels leak fluid into the retina it results in a  \\ncondition known as diabetic macular edema which causes swelling in the \\ncenter part of the eye (macula) that provides the sharp vision needed for \\nreading and recognizing faces.  \\n Prolonged damage to the small blood vessels in the retina results in poor \\ncirculation to the retina and macula prompting the development of growth \\nfactors that cause new abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization) and scar \\ntissue to grow on the surface of the retina. This stage of the disease is known \\nas proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). \\n New vessels may bleed into the middle of the eye, cause scar tissue formation, \\npull on the retina, cause retinal detachment, or may cause high pressure and \\npain if the blood vessels grow on the iris, clogging the drainage system of the \\neye—all of this can cause vision loss. \\nRisk Factors:  \\nAnyone who has diabetes is at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.  \\nAdditional factors can increase the risk:\\n•  Disease duration: the longer someone has diabetes, the greater the risk  \\nof developing diabetic retinopathy.\\n•  Poor control of blood sugar levels over time\\n•  High blood pressure\\n•  High cholesterol levels\\n•  Pregnancy\\nComplications: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned \\nthat taking some medicines could cause macular edema. People with type 2 \\ndiabetes who use certain prescription medicines, such as pioglitazone (Actos) \\nand rosiglitazone (Avandia), to treat their diabetes have been reported to \\nhave a 3 to 6 times greater risk of macular edema. \\nSYMPTOMS\\nIt is possible to have diabetic  \\nretinopathy for a long time \\nwithout noticing symptoms until \\nsubstantial damage has occurred. \\nSymptoms of diabetic retinopathy \\nmay occur in one or both eyes.\\nSymptoms may include:\\n•  Blurred or double vision\\n•  Difficulty reading\\n•  The appearance of spots— \\ncommonly called “floaters”— \\nin your vision\\n•  A shadow across the field of vision\\n•  Eye pain or pressure\\n•  Difficulty with color perception \\uf06c\\ncontinued next page\\nTHE RETINA  is a thin layer of \\nlight-sensitive nerve tissue that lines \\nthe back of the eye (or vitreous) \\ncavity.

These photos make it easier \\nfor the physician to monitor the disease on follow-up visits to determine if  \\nit is worsening. \\n To evaluate retina blood vessel circulation, the physician may conduct  \\na retinal photography test called fluorescein angiography (FA). After dilating  \\nthe pupils, the physician will inject a dye into the patient’s arm. The dye  \\nthen circulates through the eyes and works like a food coloring; however,  \\nit does not affect the kidneys and is unlike the dye that is used with MRIs  \\nand CAT scans.\\n As the dye circulates, the physician takes pictures of the retina to  \\naccurately detect blood vessels that are closed, damaged, or leaking fluid. \\nThe pictures are black and white to help the doctor detect these changes \\nmore easily, but the process is not the same as having an x-ray. Prior to  \\nexamination, ask your physician to discuss the risks and benefits of obtaining \\nthese images. \\n With proper examinations, diabetic retinopathy can be detected before \\nvision loss begins. If the physician detects signs of diabetic retinopathy, she/\\nhe will determine how frequently follow-up examinations will be required to \\ndetect changes that would require treatment.\\nTreatment and Prognosis: As a result of major government- and industry- \\nsponsored studies, there are many approved treatments for diabetic  \\nretinopathy, including intravitreal injections (small injections of medications \\ninto the middle cavity of the eye), laser treatments, and vitreous and retina \\nsurgery. These procedures can be done in an office or hospital setting to  \\nprevent, treat, or reverse damage from diabetes in the retina. \\n Research has shown that eye injections often result in better vision  \\nthan laser treatment alone for patients with diabetic macular edema.  \\nThe key to these treatments is their ability to block vascular endothelial \\ngrowth factor (VEGF), a chemical signal that stimulates leakage and  \\nabnormal blood vessel growth. Repeated doses of anti-VEGF medications \\nmay be needed to prevent blood vessels from leaking fluid and causing  \\nvision loss. \\n Even if not all vision loss from diabetic retinopathy can be prevented  \\nor treated, patients usually are able to find resources to help them  \\nlive with diminished vision. If you have been diagnosed with diabetic  \\nretinopathy or diabetes and have vision loss that cannot be reversed,  \\na retina specialist can help you find access to rehabilitation with a  \\nvariety of tools to make everyday living with this disease a little bit  \\neasier.

Despite the available treatments, some patients present\\nlate in the course of the disease when treatment is more difﬁcult. If\\ndiabetic retinopathy is detected, tightening of modiﬁable risk factors\\n(e.g. blood glucose, blood pressure) can slow disease progression.\\nWhen sight-threatening retinopathy is detected, laser treatment\\nand treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors re-\\nduces the risk of visual loss. When a stage of advanced retinopathy\\nis detected, vitrectomy operations with modern surgical techniques\\nprovide improving results for patients. Advances in optical coher-\\nence tomography technology have seen the development of high-\\ndeﬁnition three-dimensional imaging of the retina and of non-\\ninvasive, dye-free angiography, which has enhanced the understand-\\ning of and diagnostic capabilities within theﬁeld of diabetic retinop-\\nathy management.\\nKeywords Diabetic retinopathy; laser therapy; MRCP; optical\\ncoherence tomography; risk factors; screening; vascular endothelial\\ngrowth factor\\nDeﬁnition and pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy\\n(DR)\\nDR refers to pathology of the capillaries, arterioles and venules in\\nthe retina, and the subsequent effects of leakage from or occlu-\\nsion of the small vessels. Changes that occur within the retinal\\ncapillaries include:\\n/C15thickening of the basement membrane\\n/C15pericyte loss\\n/C15epithelial cell dysfunction (loss of epithelial tight\\njunctions)\\n/C15loss of endothelial cells\\n/C15smooth muscle cell death\\n/C15capillary weakening\\n/C15increased capillary permeability\\n/C15capillary occlusion\\n/C15microaneurysm formation.\\nThe microaneurysm is the hallmark of retinal microvascular\\ndisease in patients with diabetes mellitus. It has been suggested\\nthat microaneurysms may be asymmetrical dilatations of the\\ncapillary wall where it has been weakened or damaged by the\\nloss of supporting pericytes and localized increases in hydrostatic\\npressure.\\nThe Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)\\nThe ETDRS described the progression of DR in relation to the\\ndevelopment of the following lesions (Figure 1):\\n/C15microaneurysms\\n/C15small retinal haemorrhages\\n/C15haemorrhage/microaneurysm (HMa)\\n/C15other larger retinal haemorrhages\\ne ﬂame haemorrhages\\ne blot haemorrhages\\n/C15hard exudates (often just referred to as exudates)\\n/C15cotton wool spots (referred to in the ETDRS as soft exu-\\ndates, although that term is now rarely used)\\n/C15intra-retinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMAs)\\n/C15venous abnormalities\\n/C15arteriolar abnormalities\\n/C15ﬁbrous proliferation at the disc\\n/C15ﬁbrous proliferation elsewhere\\n/C15new vessels at the disc (NVDs)\\n/C15new vessels elsewhere (NVEs)\\n/C15vitreous haemorrhage\\n/C15pre-retinal haemorrhage\\n/C15laser treatment e laser scars.\\nThe ETDRS deﬁned microaneurysm and haemorrhage as\\nfollows:\\n/C15A microaneurysm is deﬁned as a red spot <125 micro-\\nmetres in size (approximately the width of a vein at the\\ndisc margin) and with sharp margins.\\n/C15Haemorrhage is deﬁned as a red spot that has irregular\\nmargins and/or uneven density, particularly when sur-\\nrounding a smaller central lesion that is considered to be a\\nmicroaneurysm. If a red lesion is>125 micrometres in its\\nlongest dimension, it is usually a haemorrhage unless\\nfeatures such as a round shape, smooth margins or central\\nlight reﬂex suggest it might be a microaneurysm.\\n/C15Because the ETDRS recognized that it was very difﬁcult to\\ndifferentiate between microaneurysms and small haemor-\\nrhages, the concept of ‘HMa’ was introduced, which is a\\nsmall haemorrhage or microaneurysm.\\nThe ETDRS deﬁned hard exudates as small white or\\nyellowish-white deposits with sharp margins, typically located in\\nthe outer layers of the retina.\\nKey points\\nC Diabetic retinopathy is still a key cause of blindness in the\\nworking population\\nC Screening and early treatment, with good blood pressure and\\nglycaemic control, are effective in preventing visual loss\\nC VEGF inhibitors are successful in treating many patients with\\ncentre involving diabetic macular oedema\\nC Laser treatment is still the standard of care for treating pro-\\nliferative diabetic retinopathy with vitrectomy operations for\\nadvanced disease\\nPeter H ScanlonMD FRCP FRCOphthis a Consultant Ophthalmologist\\nat the Gloucestershire and Oxford Eye Units, Oxford, UK, and\\nProgramme Director for the English National Diabetic Retinopathy\\nScreening Programme.

It is an imaging technique that interprets the ‘time of\\nﬂight’ and intensity of reﬂected optical waves using interferom-\\netry (Figure 5). As a result of the high level of resolution, OCT is\\nparticularly suitable for retinal thickness measurements, offering\\npenetration to approximately 2e3 mm with micrometre-scale\\naxial and lateral resolution.\\nThe ETDRS reported that focal photocoagulation of ‘clinically\\nsigniﬁcant’ diabetic macular oedema substantially reduced the\\nrisk of visual loss.

There were concerns that,\\nas VEGF has neuroprotective effects, there might be neurological\\nor cardiovascular adverse effects with signiﬁcant systemic ab-\\nsorption of anti-VEGF agents; however, these concerns do not\\nappear to have been borne out in any trials or subsequent\\nproduct evaluations. The main concern of any intravitreal treat-\\nment is the risk of endophthalmitis (infection being introduced\\ninto the eye at the time of the intravitreal injection; 0.04e0.06 per\\ninjection). There may also be a sustained elevation of intraocular\\npressure, which occurred in 9.5% of patients compared with\\n3.4% in a control group.\\nIn England, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\\nguidelines restrict this treatment to patients with a disc centre\\nthickness of 400 micrometres or more. A number of studies have\\nshown that this treatment is beneﬁcial in diabetic maculopathy\\nwhen ranubizumab,4 aﬂibercept5 or the off-label bevucizumab is\\nused. In diabetic maculopathy, there tends to be a reduction in\\ntreatment frequency required over time, with an average of 7e9\\nanti-VEGF injections being required in the ﬁrst year, 2e4 in the\\nsecond year, 1e3 in the third year and approximately one in-\\njection per year in years 4 and 5.\\nIt has been shown that inﬂammation plays a signiﬁcant role in\\nthe development of macular oedema in some patients with dia-\\nbetes. Dexamethasone implants, which last for approximately 3\\nmonths, are often given to patients who do not respond to VEGF\\ninhibitors and are pseudophakic. If these are successful without\\nsigniﬁcant elevation of the intraocular pressure, a longer lasting\\nﬂuocinolone acetonide implant is available. The response to\\ntreatment varies, with some patients responding well, some\\nresponding slowly and some not at all. An example of a patient\\nwho responded after only one treatment is shown inFigure 6.\\nAdvances in OCT have seen the development of non-invasive,\\ndye-free angiography e OCT angiography (OCTA). Fluorescein\\nangiography previously involved the intravenous injection of\\nﬂuorescein, which is associated with a very small risk of\\nanaphylaxis. Fluorescein angiography delineated the vasculature\\nas the ﬂuorescein appeared in the choroidal, arterial, arteriove-\\nnous and venous phases, and ﬂuorescein leakage from blood\\nvessels was apparent. OCTA, however, detects movement of\\nblood cells within retinal vasculature and does not detect\\nleakage. Therefore apparent absence of a blood vessel on OCTA\\ncan just represent slow blood ﬂow, and reading OCTA is very\\ndifferent from reading ﬂuorescein angiograms. Examples of\\nOCTA are shown inFigures 7 and 8. A\\nKEY REFERENCES\\n1 Liew G, Michaelides M, Bunce C.

In some instances, such as when results of carefully conducted \\nclinical trials are available, the data are particularly persuasive and provide clear guidance. In other instances, \\nthe panels have to rely on their collective judgment and evaluation of available evidence.  \\nThese documents provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular \\nindividual. While they should generally meet the needs of most patients, they cannot possibly best meet the \\nneeds of all patients. Adherence to these PPPs will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation. These \\npractice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods \\nof care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results. It may be necessary to approach different patie nts’ \\nneeds in different ways. The physician must make the ultimate judgment about the propriety of the care of a \\nparticular patient in light of all of the circumstances presented by that patient. The American Academy of \\nOphthalmology is available to assist members in resolving ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of \\nophthalmic practice. \\nPreferred Practice Pattern® guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual \\nsituations. The Academy specifically disclaims any and all liability for injury or other damages of any kind, \\nfrom negligence or otherwise, for any and all claims that may arise out of the use of any recommendations or \\nother information contained herein. \\nReferences to certain drugs, instruments, and other products are made for illustrative purposes only and are \\nnot intended to constitute an endorsement of such. Such material may include information on applications \\nthat are not considered community standard, that reflect indications not included in approved U.S. Food and \\nDrug Administration (FDA) labeling, or that are approved for use only in restricted research settings.  The \\nFDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA status of each drug or \\ndevice he or she wishes to use, and to use them with appropriate patient consent in compliance with \\napplicable law. \\nInnovation in medicine is essential to ensure the future health of the American public, and the Academy \\nencourages the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods that will improve eye care. It is \\nessential to recognize that true medical excellence is achieved only when the patients’ needs are the foremost \\nconsideration. \\nAll Preferred Practice Pattern® guidelines are reviewed by their parent panel annually or earlier if \\ndevelopments warrant and updated accordingly. To ensure that all PPPs are current, each is valid for 5 years \\nfrom the “approved by” date unless superseded by a revision. Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are funded \\nby the Academy without commercial support. Authors and reviewers of PPPs are volunteers and do not \\nreceive any financial compensation for their contributions to the documents. The PPPs are externally \\nreviewed by experts and stakeholders, including consumer representatives, before publication. The PPP s are \\ndeveloped in compliance with the Council of Medical Specialty Societies’ Code for Interactions with \\nCompanies. The Academy has Relationship with Industry Procedures (available at www.aao.org/about-\\npreferred-practice-patterns) to comply with the Code.  \\nAppendix 2 contains the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems \\n(ICD) codes for the disease entities that this PPP covers.

Where evidence exists to support a recommendation for care, the \\nrecommendation should be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence. To accomplish \\nthese aims, methods from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network1 (SIGN) and the Grading of \\nRecommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation2 (GRADE) group are used. GRADE is a \\nsystematic approach to grading the strength of the total body of evidence that is available to support \\nrecommendations on a specific clinical management issue. Organizations that have adopted GRADE \\ninclude SIGN, the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Policy, and the \\nAmerican College of Physicians.3 \\n\\uf075 All studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded for strength of evidence individually, and \\nthat grade is listed with the study citation. \\n\\uf075 To rate individual studies, a scale based on SIGN1 is used. The definitions and levels of evidence to rate \\nindividual studies are as follows: \\nI++ High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs),  or \\nRCTs with a very low risk of bias \\nI+ Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias  \\nI- Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias  \\nII++ High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies  \\nHigh-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a \\nhigh probability that the relationship is causal \\nII+ Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a \\nmoderate probability that the relationship is causal \\nII- Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that \\nthe relationship is not causal \\nIII Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series) \\n \\n\\uf075 Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence. The body of evidence quality \\nratings are defined by GRADE2 as follows: \\nGood quality Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of \\neffect \\nModerate quality Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the \\nestimate of effect and may change the estimate \\nInsufficient quality Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in \\nthe estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate \\nAny estimate of effect is very uncertain \\n \\n\\uf075 Key recommendations for care are defined by GRADE2 as follows:  \\nStrong \\nrecommendation \\nUsed when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the \\nundesirable effects or clearly do not \\nDiscretionary \\nrecommendation \\nUsed when the trade-offs are less certain— either because of low-quality evidence \\nor because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely \\nbalanced \\n  \\n\\uf075 The Highlighted Findings and Recommendations for Care section lists points determined by the PPP \\nPanel to be of particular importance to vision and quality of life outcomes.  \\n\\uf075 All recommendations for care in this PPP were rated using the system described above. To locate ratings \\nfor specific recommendations, see Appendix 3 for additional information. \\n\\uf075 A literature search to update the PPP was undertaken in June 2013 in PubMed and the Cochrane Library. \\nComplete details of the literature search are available at www.aao.org/ppp.'),\n",

Although defects \\nin neurosensory function have been demonstrated in patients with diabetes mellitus prior to the onset \\nof vascular lesions, the most common early clinically visible manifestations of diabetic retinopathy \\ninclude microaneurysm formation and intraretinal hemorrhages. Microvascular damage leads to \\nretinal capillary nonperfusion, cotton wool spots, increased numbers of hemorrhages, venous \\nabnormalities, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA). During this stage, increased \\nvasopermeability can result in retinal thickening (edema) and/or exudates that may lead to a loss in \\ncentral visual acuity. The proliferative stage results from closure of arterioles and venules with \\nsecondary proliferation of new vessels on the disc, retina, iris, and in the filtration angle. These new \\nvessels then lead to traction retinal detachments and neovascular glaucoma, respectively. Vision can \\nbe lost in this stage as a result of capillary nonperfusion or edema in the macula, vitreous hemorrhage, \\nand distortion or traction retinal detachment. \\nA description of the fundus findings in various stages of diabetic retinopathy is included in the \\nNatural History section, and important terms are defined in the Glossary.  \\nPATIENT POPULATION  \\nThe patient population includes all patients with diabetes mellitus. \\nCLINICAL OBJECTIVES  \\n\\uf075 Identify patients at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. \\n\\uf075 Encourage a collaborative approach between the patient, the primary care physician, and \\nsubspecialists in the management of the patient’s systemic disorder, with specific attention to control \\nof blood sugar (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), blood pressure, serum lipids, body weight, and management \\nof renal disease, coronary artery disease,4 and neuropathy. \\n\\uf075 Encourage and provide lifelong monitoring of retinopathy progression. \\n\\uf075 Treat patients with visual loss or those at risk for visual loss from diabetic retinopathy.  \\n\\uf075 Minimize the side effects of treatment that might adversely affect the patient’s vision and/or vision-\\nrelated quality of life. \\n\\uf075 Provide or refer for visual rehabilitation services when a patient has visual impairment from the \\ndisease.  \\n \\n \\nBACKGROUND  \\nINTRODUCTION \\nTwo forms of diabetes mellitus are recognized. Type 1, previously called juvenile -onset or insulin-\\ndependent diabetes, is characterized by cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells in \\nthe pancreas and usually leads to severe insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes was previously referred to \\nas adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes. Type 2 is characterized by a range of disease from \\ninsulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to predominately an insulin secretory defect \\ncombined with insulin resistance. Type 2 patients usually have a relative rather than an absolute \\ninsulin deficiency, may take insulin, yet typically do not need insulin for survival. Many patients with \\nType 2 diabetes are obese, and obesity itself causes relative insulin resistance. Between 90% and 95% \\nof all patients with diabetes have Type 2 diabetes.5 Because of the disproportionately large number of \\npatients with Type 2 diabetes, this group comprises a larger proportion of the disease burden in \\npatients with visual impairment from diabetic retinopathy, even though Type 1 diabetes is associated \\nwith more frequent and more severe ocular complications.6, 7'),\n",

Clearly, these trends \\npredict an increase in the number of individuals with diabetes as well as the associated \\nincreased costs for health care and the burdens of disability associated with diabetes and its \\ncomplications.  \\nPrevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy \\nDiabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of new cases of legal blindness among working -age \\nAmericans and represents a leading cause of blindness in this age group worldwide. 26 The \\nprevalence rate for retinopathy for all adults with diabetes aged 40 and older in the United \\nStates is 28.5% (4.2 million people); worldwide, the prevalence rate has been estimated at \\n34.6% (93 million people). An estimate of the prevalence rate for vision-threatening diabetic \\nretinopathy (VTDR) in the United States is 4.4% (0.7 million people). Worldwide, this \\nprevalence rate has been estimated at 10.2% (28 million people).27, 28 Assuming a similar \\nprevalence of diabetes mellitus, the projected prevalence of individuals with any diabetic \\nretinopathy in the United States by the year 2020 is 6 million persons, and 1.34 million persons \\nwill have VTDR. \\nRISK FACTORS  \\nDuration of diabetes is a major risk factor associated with the development of diabetic retinopathy. \\nAfter 5 years, approximately 25% of Type 1 patients will have retinopathy. After 10 years, almost \\n60% have retinopathy, and after 15 years, 80% have retinopathy.29, 30 In the Wisconsin Epidemiologic \\nStudy of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) for patients ages 30 and younger, proliferative diabetic \\nretinopathy (PDR), the most vision-threatening form of the disease, was present in approximately \\n50% of Type 1 patients who had the disease for 20 years.31 In the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study \\n(LALES) and in Proyecto VER (Vision, Evaluation and Research), 18% of participants with diabetes \\nof more than 15 years’ duration had PDR, with no difference in the percentage with PDR between \\nthose with Type 1 versus Type 2 diabetes.30, 32 \\nOf Type 2 patients over the age of 30 who have a known duration of diabetes of less than 5 years, \\n40% of those patients taking insulin and 24% of those not taking insulin have retinopathy. These rates \\nincrease to 84% and 53%, respectively, when the duration of diabetes has been documented for up to \\n19 years. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy develops in 2% of Type 2 patients who have diabetes for \\nless than 5 years and in 25% of patients who have diabetes for 25 years or more.33 Comparisons of \\ninformation from WESDR and more recent population-based studies such as Proyecto VER and \\nLALES may account for differences in blood glucose and hypertension management that have \\noccurred over time.'),\n",

Support for this association is based on both clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. 34-41 \\nThere is general agreement that duration of diabetes and severity of hyperglycemia are the major risk \\nfactors for developing retinopathy. Once retinopathy is present, duration of diabetes appears to be a \\nless important factor than glycemic control in forecasting progression from earlier to later stages of \\nretinopathy.42, 43 It is recommended that a HbA1c of 7% or lower is the target for glycemic control in \\nmost patients, whereas in selected patients, there may be some benefit to setting a lower target of \\n6.5%.44 Intensive management of hypertension may slow retinopathy progression, yet the data remain \\ninconclusive.45, 46 Large studies have suggested that management of serum lipids may reduce \\nretinopathy progression and the need for treatment.47-50 There is less agreement among studies \\nconcerning the importance of other factors such as age, type of diabetes, clotting factors, renal \\ndisease, physical inactivity, inflammatory biomarkers, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme \\ninhibitors.42, 48, 51-54 Many of these factors are associated with substantial cardiovascular morbidity and \\nmortality and other complications associated with diabetes. Thus, ophthalmologists should  encourage \\npatients with diabetes to be as compliant as possible with therapy of all medical aspects of their \\ndisease.55 \\nNATURAL HISTORY  \\nDiabetic retinopathy progresses in an orderly fashion from mild to more severe stages when there is \\nnot appropriate intervention. It is important to recognize the stages when treatment may be mo st \\nbeneficial. Several decades of clinical research have provided excellent data on the natural course of \\nthe disease and on treatment strategies that are 90% effective in preventing the occurrence of severe \\nvision loss.56 The outcomes of key clinical trials form a solid foundation in support of treating diabetic \\nretinopathy. The results of these studies are summarized in Appendices 4 and 5. Major studies include \\nthe following (see Glossary):  \\n\\uf075 Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)36, 57, 58  \\n\\uf075 Follow-up study to the DCCT titled Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications \\n(EDIC)35, 37, 49, 59, 60  \\n\\uf075 Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS)61, 62  \\n\\uf075 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)63-65  \\n\\uf075 Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study (DRVS)66  \\n\\uf075 Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR)67  \\n\\uf075 Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study68  \\n\\uf075 Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial69  \\n\\uf075 Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) Protocol I study70 \\n\\uf075 United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)38, 45, 71 \\nThe nonproliferative stages of diabetic retinopathy are characterized by retinal vascular related \\nabnormalities, such as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, venous dilation, and cotton- wool \\nspots. Increased retinal vascular permeability that occurs at these or later stages of retinopathy may \\nresult in retinal thickening (edema) and lipid deposits (hard exudates). Clinically significant macular \\nedema (CSME) is a term commonly used to describe retinal thickening and/or adjacent hard exudates \\nthat either involve the center of the macula or threaten to involve it. Patients with CSME should be \\nconsidered for prompt treatment, particularly when the center of the macula is already involved or if \\nretinal thickening and/or hard exudates are very close to the center (see Care Process). Clinically \\nsignificant macular edema can be divided into center-involving and non-center-involving macular \\nedema. (See Glossary.) \\nAs diabetic retinopathy progresses, there is a gradual closure of retinal vessels that results in impaired \\nperfusion and retinal ischemia. Signs of increasing ischemia include venous abnormalities (e.g., \\ndilation, beading, loops), IRMA, and more severe and extensive vascular leakage characterized by \\nincreasing retinal hemorrhages and exudation. When these signs progress beyond certain defined \\nthresholds, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is diagnosed. Such patients should be \\nconsidered candidates for treatment with panretinal (scatter) photocoagulation (see Care Process).'),\n",

(See Appendix 4.)

Further studies are required to determine the \\nlong-term implications of using anti-VEGF agents alone.130 Additional panretinal \\nphotocoagulation, anti-VEGF therapy, or vitrectomy surgery may be necessary to address \\nincreasing neovascularization of the iris and should be considered for the following \\nsituations:  \\n\\uf075 Failure of the neovascularization to regress \\n\\uf075 Increasing neovascularization of the retina or iris \\n\\uf075 New vitreous hemorrhage \\n\\uf075 New areas of neovascularization \\nFor patients who have CSME in addition to high-risk PDR, combined anti-VEGF therapy \\nand panretinal photocoagulation at the first treatment session and in the early stages of such \\nhigher risk eyes could also be considered. Fluorescein angiography does not usually need \\nto be performed in order to apply the panretinal photocoagulation effectively. However, a \\nfluorescein angiogram may be used to guide focal photocoagulation. In some cases, \\nvitreous hemorrhage may recur in patients who have had extensive panretinal \\nphotocoagulation. These hemorrhages may be due to traction on pre-existing or involuted \\nneovascularization. They may clear spontaneously and do not necessarily require additional \\npanretinal laser surgery. \\nSome patients with previously untreated PDR who have vitreous opacities and active \\nneovascular or fibrovascular proliferation should be considered as candidates for pars plana \\nvitrectomy.66, 172-174 The value of early vitrectomy tends to increase with the increasing \\nseverity of neovascularization. (See Appendix 4.) The role of anti-VEGFs in these later \\nstages of proliferative retinopathy is under investigation.'),\n",

Furthermore, advanced active PDR may persist \\ndespite extensive panretinal photocoagulation. In such cases, vitrectomy surgery may be \\nindicated. Vitreous surgery is frequently indicated in patients with macula-threatening \\ntraction retinal detachment (particularly of recent onset), combined traction-\\nrhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage precluding panretinal \\nphotocoagulation. Patients with vitreous hemorrhage and rubeosis iridis also should be \\nconsidered for prompt vitrectomy and intraoperative panretinal photocoagulation surgery. \\nThe role of anti-VEGFs in treatment of these cases is under investigation. \\nOther Treatments  \\nSeveral studies have evaluated the use of intravitreal administration of short- and long-acting \\ncorticosteroids for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and the use of anti-VEGF agents in \\nthe treatment of PDR. An earlier DRCR.net study evaluated the role of intravitreal \\ntriamcinolone acetonide compared with focal laser photocoagulation. Treatment with \\nintravitreal triamcinolone acetonide resulted in an early decrease in retinal thickness at 4 \\nmonths, yet by 24 months those patients randomized to focal/grid laser photocoagulation had \\nbetter mean visual acuity and fewer adverse effects of cataract development and elevation of \\nIOP.175 At 3 years, these results were largely unchanged.176 However, this study did not \\nevaluate the role of intravitreal corticosteroids plus standard focal/grid laser photocoagulation \\ncompared with laser photocoagulation alone. A subsequent study showed increased visual gain \\nin pseudophakic eyes that were given the combination of the intravitreal triamcinolone \\nacetonide and laser; however, even in this group the eyes treated with anti-VEGF agents tended \\nto do better overall.131, 144 Future studies will help define the role of corticosteroids in the \\ntreatment strategies for persons with diabetic macular edema.  \\nMicropulse laser treatment as well as FA-guided therapy have also been advocated. Studies \\nsuggest that micropulse laser induces less damage to the macula, and several studies using this \\nmethod have shown encouraging results. This method has not been compared with standard or \\nmodified ETDRS laser surgery in randomized clinical trials.177 \\nFollow-Up Evaluation \\nThe follow-up evaluation includes a history and examination.  \\nHistory \\nA follow-up history should include changes in the following: \\n\\uf075 Symptoms \\n\\uf075 Systemic status (pregnancy, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, renal status) \\n\\uf075 Glycemic status (HbA1c)42, 58, 100 \\nExamination \\nA follow-up examination should include the following elements: \\n\\uf075 Visual acuity102 \\n\\uf075 Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with iris examination178  \\n\\uf075 Intraocular pressure \\n\\uf075  Gonioscopy (preferably before dilation when iris neovascularization is suspected or if IOP \\nis elevated)178  \\n\\uf075  Stereoscopic examination of the posterior pole after dilation of the pupils65 \\n\\uf075 OCT imaging, when appropriate \\n\\uf075 Peripheral retina and vitreous examination, when indicated64 \\nRecommended intervals for follow-up are given in Table 6. \\nPROVIDER AND SETTING  \\nAlthough the ophthalmologist will perform most of the examination and all surgery, certain aspects of \\ndata collection may be performed by trained individuals under the ophthalmologist’s supervision and'),\n",

Because of the complexities of the diagnosis and treatment for diabetic retinopathy, the \\nophthalmologist caring for patients with this condition should be familiar with the specific \\nrecommendations of relevant clinical trials.37, 70, 101, 102, 117, 150-152, 158, 179-186 \\nPHYSICIAN QUALITY REPORTING SYSTEM  \\nThe Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) program, initially launched by the Centers for \\nMedicare and Medicaid Services in July 2007, encourages quality improvement through the use of \\nclinical performance measures on a variety of clinical conditions. Measures in the 2014 program for \\ndiabetic eye care include an annual dilated eye examination for patients with diabetes, documentation \\nof the level of severity of retinopathy and the presence or absence of macular edema, and \\ncommunication of examination results to the physician managing ongoing diabetes care for patients \\nwith diabetic retinopathy.187 \\nCOUNSELING AND REFERRAL  \\nThe ophthalmologist should refer patients with diabetes to a primary care physician for appropriate \\nmanagement of their systemic condition and should communicate examination results to the physician \\nmanaging the patient’s ongoing diabetes care. An Eye MD Examination Report Form is available \\nfrom the American Academy of Ophthalmology.188 \\nSome patients with diabetic retinopathy will lose substantial vision despite being treated according to \\nthe recommendations in this document.170 Patients whose conditions fail to respond to surgery and \\nthose for whom further treatment is unavailable should be provided with proper professional support \\nand offered referral for counseling, vision rehabilitation, or social services as appropriate. 189 Vision \\nrehabilitation restores functional ability,190 and patients with functionally limiting postoperative visual \\nimpairment should be referred for vision rehabilitation and social services.189 More information on \\nvision rehabilitation, including materials for patients, is available at www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-\\nvision. \\nSOCIOECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS  \\nOne analysis of medical and economic effects of diabetic retinopathy control predicted that over their \\nlifetime, 72% of patients with Type 1 diabetes would eventually develop PDR requiring panretinal \\nphotocoagulation and that 42% will develop macular edema.191 If treatments are delivered as \\nrecommended in the clinical trials, the model predicted a cost of $966 per person-year of vision saved \\nfor patients with PDR and $1120 per person-year of central visual acuity saved for patients with \\nmacular edema. These costs are less than the cost of a year of Social Security disability payments for \\npatients disabled by vision loss. Therefore, treatment yields a substantial savings compared with the \\ndirect cost to society of untreated PDR in a Type 1 diabetic patient.192 The indirect costs in lost \\nproductivity and human suffering are even greater. \\nAnother analysis estimated that screening and treatment of eye disease in patients with diabetes costs, \\non average, $3190 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved.193 For patients with Type 1 diabetes, \\nit costs $1996 per QALY saved; for patients with Type 2 diabetes who use insulin, it costs $2933 per \\nQALY saved; and for patients with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin, it costs $3530 per QALY \\nsaved. Insofar as patients with Type 2 diabetes not using insulin represent the largest subset of the \\npatient population, most of the economic benefits of screening and treatment are realized among  these \\npatients.  \\nA recent (2013) cost-effectiveness analysis of various interventions for diabetic macular edema \\nevaluated the cost effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapies for CSME. Compared with laser alone, the \\nincremental cost-effectiveness of laser plus bevacizumab is $11,138/QALY and thus seems to confer \\nthe greatest value among the various treatment options for CSME.194 By comparison, the cost-utility \\nof laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular edema is $3101/QALY,195 whereas laser \\nphotocoagulation for extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization is $23,640/QALY.196 Finally, a cost-\\nutility analysis of detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with Typ e 1 and Type 2 \\ndiabetes demonstrates that provision of recommended ophthalmic care would reduce the prevalence \\nof blindness by 52% and that the direct costs of care would be less than the losses in productivity and \\nthe costs of facilities provided for disability.197'),\n",

QUALITY OF OPHTHALMIC \\nCARE CORE CRITERIA \\n \\nProviding quality care \\nis the physician's foremost ethical obligation, and is \\nthe basis of public trust in physicians. \\nAMA Board of Trustees, 1986 \\nQuality ophthalmic care is provided in a manner and with the skill that is consistent with the best interests of \\nthe patient. The discussion that follows characterizes the core elements of such care.  \\nThe ophthalmologist is first and foremost a physician. As such, the ophthalmologist demonstrates \\ncompassion and concern for the individual, and utilizes the science and art of medicine to help alleviate \\npatient fear and suffering. The ophthalmologist strives to develop and maintain clinical skills at the highest \\nfeasible level, consistent with the needs of patients, through training and continuing education. The \\nophthalmologist evaluates those skills and medical knowledge in relation to the needs of the patient and \\nresponds accordingly. The ophthalmologist also ensures that needy patients receive necessary care dir ectly or \\nthrough referral to appropriate persons and facilities that will provide such care, and he or she supports \\nactivities that promote health and prevent disease and disability. \\nThe ophthalmologist recognizes that disease places patients in a disadvantaged, dependent state. The \\nophthalmologist respects the dignity and integrity of his or her patients, and does not exploit their \\nvulnerability. \\nQuality ophthalmic care has the following optimal attributes, among others. \\n\\uf075 The essence of quality care is a meaningful partnership relationship between patient and physician. The \\nophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively with his or her patients, listening carefully to their \\nneeds and concerns. In turn, the ophthalmologist educates his or her patients about the nature and \\nprognosis of their condition and about proper and appropriate therapeutic modalities. This is to ensure \\ntheir meaningful participation (appropriate to their unique physical, intellectual, and emotional state) in \\ndecisions affecting their management and care, to improve their motivation and compliance with the \\nagreed plan of treatment, and to help alleviate their fears and concerns. \\n\\uf075 The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and \\ntherapeutic modalities as well as the frequency of evaluation and follow-up, with due regard to the \\nurgency and nature of the patient's condition and unique needs and desires. \\n\\uf075 The ophthalmologist carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately  trained, \\nexperienced, and competent, or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is, depending on the \\nurgency of the problem and availability and accessibility of alternative providers.  \\n\\uf075 Patients are assured access to, and continuity of, needed and appropriate ophthalmic care, which can be \\ndescribed as follows. \\n\\uf077 The ophthalmologist treats patients with due regard to timeliness, appropriateness, and his or her own \\nability to provide such care. \\n\\uf077 The operating ophthalmologist makes adequate provision for appropriate pre- and postoperative \\npatient care. \\n\\uf077 When the ophthalmologist is unavailable for his or her patient, he or she provides appropriate alternate \\nophthalmic care, with adequate mechanisms for informing patients of the existence of such care and \\nprocedures for obtaining it. \\n\\uf077 The ophthalmologist refers patients to other ophthalmologists and eye care providers based on the \\ntimeliness and appropriateness of such referral, the patient's needs, the competence and qualifications \\nof the person to whom the referral is made, and access and availability.\"),\n",

Quality of Ophthalmic Care Core Criteria \\n \\n23 \\n\\uf077 The ophthalmologist seeks appropriate consultation with due regard to the nature of the ocular or other \\nmedical or surgical problem. Consultants are suggested for their skill, competence, and accessibility. \\nThey receive as complete and accurate an accounting of the problem as necessary to provide efficient \\nand effective advice or intervention, and in turn they respond in an adequate and timely manner. The \\nophthalmologist maintains complete and accurate medical records. \\n\\uf077 On appropriate request, the ophthalmologist provides a full and accurate rendering of the patient's \\nrecords in his or her possession. \\n\\uf077 The ophthalmologist reviews the results of consultations and laboratory tests in a timely and effective \\nmanner and takes appropriate actions. \\n\\uf077 The ophthalmologist and those who assist in providing care identify themselves and their profession.  \\n\\uf077 For patients whose conditions fail to respond to treatment and for whom further treatm ent is \\nunavailable, the ophthalmologist provides proper professional support, counseling, rehabilitative and \\nsocial services, and referral as appropriate and accessible. \\n\\uf075 Prior to therapeutic or invasive diagnostic procedures, the ophthalmologist becomes ap propriately \\nconversant with the patient's condition by collecting pertinent historical information and performing \\nrelevant preoperative examinations. Additionally, he or she enables the patient to reach a fully informed \\ndecision by providing an accurate and truthful explanation of the diagnosis; the nature, purpose, risks, \\nbenefits, and probability of success of the proposed treatment and of alternative treatment; and the risks \\nand benefits of no treatment. \\n\\uf075 The ophthalmologist adopts new technology (e.g., drugs, devices, surgical techniques) in judicious \\nfashion, appropriate to the cost and potential benefit relative to existing alternatives and to its \\ndemonstrated safety and efficacy. \\n\\uf075 The ophthalmologist enhances the quality of care he or she provides by periodically reviewing and \\nassessing his or her personal performance in relation to established standards, and by revising or altering \\nhis or her practices and techniques appropriately. \\n\\uf075 The ophthalmologist improves ophthalmic care by communicating to colleagues, through appropriate \\nprofessional channels, knowledge gained through clinical research and practice. This includes alerting \\ncolleagues of instances of unusual or unexpected rates of complications and problems related to new \\ndrugs, devices, or procedures. \\n\\uf075 The ophthalmologist provides care in suitably staffed and equipped facilities adequate to deal with \\npotential ocular and systemic complications requiring immediate attention. \\n\\uf075 The ophthalmologist also provides ophthalmic care in a manner that is cost effective without \\nunacceptably compromising accepted standards of quality. \\n \\nReviewed by: Council \\nApproved by: Board of Trustees \\nOctober 12, 1988 \\n2nd Printing: January 1991 \\n3rd Printing: August 2001 \\n4th Printing: July 2005\"),\n",

Major Study Results \\n \\n37 \\nResults of Early Scatter Laser Treatment in ETDRS  \\nIn eyes with NPDR or non-high-risk PDR, early panretinal photocoagulation was compared \\nwith deferral of photocoagulation, and although there was a beneficial treatment effect, the \\noutlook for maintaining vision was good in both groups. The 5-year rates of severe visual loss \\nor vitrectomy ranged from 2% to 6% in eyes assigned to early photocoagulation and from 4% to \\n10% in eyes assigned to deferral. Early panretinal photocoagulation was associated with side \\neffects (small decreases in visual acuity and visual field) in some eyes, and the ETDRS \\nconcluded that deferral of photocoagulation was preferable at least until retinopathy was \\napproaching the high-risk stage. Eyes approaching that stage had a 50% risk of reaching it \\nwithin 12 to 18 months. Eyes in this category had very severe NPDR or non-high-risk PDR \\ncharacterized by NVD less than one-quarter to one-third disc area and/or NVE, without vitreous \\nor preretinal hemorrhage. \\nRecent additional analyses of visual outcome in ETDRS patients with severe NPDR to non -\\nhigh-risk PDR suggest that the recommendation to consider panretinal photocoagulation before \\nthe development of high-risk PDR is particularly appropriate for patients with Type 2 \\ndiabetes.170 The risk of severe vision loss or vitrectomy was reduced by 50% in patients who \\nwere treated early compared with those who deferred treatment until high-risk PDR developed. \\nFor patients with Type 1 diabetes, the timing of the panretinal photocoagulation will depend on \\nthe compliance with follow-up, status and response to treatment of the fellow eye, impending \\ncataract surgery, and/or pregnancy status. \\nDIABETIC RETINOPATHY VITRECTOMY STUDY (1983–1987) \\nThe Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study (DRVS) investigated the role of vitrectomy in managing \\neyes with very severe PDR.66, 172-174 The benefit of early vitrectomy for severe vitreous hemorrhage \\n(defined as hemorrhage obscuring the macula or major retinal vessels for three disc diameters from \\nthe macular center) was seen in Type 1 patients, but no such advantage was found in Type 2 pa tients, \\nwho did not benefit from earlier surgery. Early vitrectomy was beneficial among patients with visual \\nacuity of 5/200 or worse and severe vitreous hemorrhage with reduced vision for at least 1 month and \\nwithout previous treatment or complications such as retinal detachment or neovascularization of the \\niris. Overall, at 2 years after surgery, 25% of the early vitrectomy group and 15% of the deferral group \\nhad visual acuity of 20/40 or better. The advantage was most pronounced in patients with Type  1 \\ndiabetes (36% vs. 12% for early vitrectomy versus deferral of vitrectomy, respectively) and was not \\nstatistically significant for patients with Type 2 diabetes. \\nThe DRVS showed that early vitrectomy was beneficial for patients with visual acuity of 20/400 o r \\nbetter plus one of the following: (1) severe neovascularization and fibrous proliferation; (2) fibrous \\nproliferation and moderate vitreous hemorrhage; or (3) moderate neovascularization, severe fibrous \\nproliferation, and moderate vitreous hemorrhage. Among such patients, 44% with early vitrectomy \\nand 28% in the observation group had visual acuity of 20/40 or better at 4 years of follow -up. \\nThe results of the DRVS should be interpreted in light of subsequent advances in vitreoretinal \\nsurgery, such as the introduction of small-gauge vitrectomy technology, endoscopic and indirect \\nophthalmoscopic laser photocoagulation, and advanced instrumentation. The use of long -acting \\nintraocular gases such as sulfur hexafluoride and perfluoropropane, the use of viscodisse ction, and the \\nuse of heavier-than-water liquids such as perfluoro-octane are advances in vitreoretinal surgery that \\ndeveloped after the DRVS. Thus, the results may actually be better than those reported in the \\nDRVS.136, 198 Early vitrectomy should be considered for selected patients with Type 2 diabetes, \\nparticularly those in whom severe vitreous hemorrhage prohibits laser therapy photocoagulation of \\nactive neovascularization.'),\n",

Fenofibrate did \\nnot significantly reduce the risk of the primary outcome of coronary events. It did reduce total \\ncardiovascular events, mainly due to fewer nonfatal myocardial infarctions and revascularization s. \\nThe higher rate of starting statin therapy in patients allocated to receive placebo might have masked a \\nmoderately larger treatment benefit. \\nDIABETIC RETINOPATHY CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK (DRCR.NET) \\n(2002–PRESENT) \\nThe Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) is a collaborative network \\ndedicated to facilitating multicenter clinical research of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, \\nand associated conditions. The DRCR.net supports the identification, design, and implementation of \\nmulticenter clinical research initiatives focused on diabetes-induced retinal disorders. Principal \\nemphasis is placed on clinical trials, but epidemiologic outcomes and other research may be supported \\nas well.  \\nThe DRCR.net was formed in 2002 and currently includes over 109 participating sites (offices) with \\nover 320 physicians throughout the United States. The DRCR.net is funded by the National Eye \\nInstitute (NEI), which is a part of the National Institutes of Health, the branch of government that \\nfunds medical research.  \\nThe DRCR.net has completed multiple clinical trials evaluating the role of anti-VEGF, laser \\ntreatment, and corticosteroids in diabetic macular edema. One of the most important is Protocol I: \\nIntravitreal Ranibizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema with Prompt vs. Deferred Laser Treatment. \\nThree-year results were reported in 2012. The study utilized ranibizumab monthly until improvement \\nno longer occurred (with resumption if the condition worsened) and random assignment to focal/grid \\nlaser treatment promptly or deferred (≥24 weeks). The 3-year results suggest that focal/grid laser \\ntreatment at the initiation of intravitreal ranibizumab is no better, and possibly worse for vision \\noutcomes, than deferring laser treatment for ≥24 weeks in eyes with DME involving the fovea and \\nwith vision impairment.70 \\nA previous publication from Protocol I results confirmed the 1 year results that intravitreal \\nranibizumab with prompt or deferred laser was more effective through 2 years compared with prompt \\nlaser alone for the treatment of DME involving the central macula. Laser was not associated with \\nendophthalmitis, the rare but potentially devastating complication of injecting ranibizumab. In \\npseudophakic eyes, results with intravitreal triamcinolone plus prompt laser appeared similar to \\nresults in the ranibizumab arms and were more effective than laser alone, but the triamcinolone plus \\nprompt laser arm had an increased risk of IOP elevation.131 \\nSTUDY OF RANIBIZUMAB INJECTION IN SUBJECTS WITH CSDME WITH CENTER \\nINVOLVEMENT SECONDARY TO DIABETES MELLITUS (RISE AND RIDE) \\nThe RISE and RIDE trials were parallel phase III multicenter double- masked sham injection–\\ncontrolled randomized studies conducted at private and university-based retina specialty clinics in the \\nUnited States and South America.

The studies utilized monthly intravitreal \\nranibizumab (0.5 or 0.3 mg) or sham injections, with macular laser available if needed.

GLYCEMIC CONTROL  \\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial \\ndesigned to study the connection between glycemic control and retinal, renal, and neurologic complications \\nof Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Published results from this trial demonstrated that improved blood sugar control \\ncan delay the onset and slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in Type 1 \\npatients.57 The DCCT showed a strong exponential relationship between the risk of diabetic retinopathy and \\nthe mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level. For each 10% decrease in the HbA1c (e.g., from 9% to 8.1%), there \\nwas a 39% decrease in the risk of progression of retinopathy over the range of HbA1c values. There was no \\nglycemic threshold when the risk of retinopathy was eliminated above the nondiabetic range of HbA 1c (4% to \\n6.05%). \\nAfter 6.5 years of follow-up, the DCCT ended, and all patients were encouraged to pursue strict control of \\nblood sugar. Most of these patients are being followed in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and \\nComplications (EDIC) study, which includes 95% of the DCCT subjects. A total of 1294 to 133 5 patients \\nhave been examined annually in the EDIC study. Further progression of diabetic retinopathy during the first \\n4 years of the EDIC study was 66% to 77% less in the former intensive treatment group than in the former \\nconventional treatment group.35 The benefit persisted even at 7 years. This benefit included an effect on \\nsevere diabetic retinopathy, including severe NPDR, PDR, CSME, and the need for focal/grid or panretinal \\nlaser photocoagulation.37 The decrease in HbA1c from 9% to approximately 8% did not drastically reduce the \\nprogression of diabetic retinopathy in the former conventional treatment group, nor did the increase in HbA 1c \\nfrom approximately 7% to approximately 8% drastically accelerate diabetic retinopathy in the former \\nintensive treatment group.35 Thus, it takes time for improvements in control to negate the long-lasting effects \\nof prior prolonged hyperglycemia, and once the biological effects of prolonged improved control are \\nmanifest, the benefits are long-lasting. Furthermore, the total glycemic exposure of the patient (i.e., degree \\nand duration) determines the degree of retinopathy observed at any one time. \\nA positive relationship between the 4-year incidence and progression of retinopathy and glycosylated \\nhemoglobin remains after controlling for other risk factors, such as duration of diabetes and severity of \\nretinopathy at a baseline examination.51, 52, 100 Extrapolation of pathologic and clinical experience strongly \\nsuggests that poor levels of control contribute to microangiopathy, including retinopathy. 199 The development \\nof PDR parallels an increased risk of nephropathy, myocardial infarction, and/or cerebral vascular accidents.  \\nAlthough good glycemic control is advised, there is some evidence that rapid improvement of long -standing \\npoor control may increase the risk of retinopathy progression over the first year for some patients. About \\n10% of Type 1 patients who had initial retinopathy at the beginning of the DCCT had increased retinopathy \\nprogression.200 Specifically, there may be a transient increase in the number of cotton-wool spots seen on \\nretinal examination. Frequent ophthalmologic monitoring is important when diabetic patients are being \\nbrought under better metabolic control.200 \\nIn the DCCT there was a threefold increase in severe hypoglycemic events and excess weight gain among \\npatients using intensive treatment regimens. Increased risk of hypoglycemia is a consequence of strict blood \\nglucose control. Irregular food intake, failure to check blood glucose before planned or unplanned vigorous \\nexercise or before operating a motor vehicle, and excess alcohol are risk factors for hypoglycemia. Diabetes \\nmellitus education and regular reinforcement should be provided by diabetes nurses and dietitian educa tors \\nand may help minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. \\nThe United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS),38, 96 a randomized controlled clinical trial of \\nblood glucose control, enrolled 3867 patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. Intensive blood glucose \\ncontrol by either the sulfonylureas or insulin decreased the risk of microvascular complications but not the \\nrisk of macrovascular disease. There were no adverse effects of the individual drugs on the cardiovascular \\noutcome. In this study, there was a 29% reduction in the need for retinal photocoagulation in the group that \\nhad intensive glucose therapy compared with those that had conventional treatment (relative risk, 0.71; 95% \\nconfidence interval, 0.53–0.96; P=0.003). \\nThe ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) study (www.accordtrial.org) was a large \\nclinical trial of adults with established Type 2 diabetes who are at especially high risk of cardiovascular \\ndisease (CVD). Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of a number of complications, especially CVD, which is \\nthe leading cause of early death in people with diabetes.'),\n",

Glycemic Control \\n \\n41 \\nThe ACCORD study consisted primarily of three clinical trials that tested treatment approaches to determine \\nthe best ways to decrease the high rate of major CVD events—heart attack, stroke, or death from CVD —\\namong people with Type 2 diabetes who are at especially high risk of having such a CVD event. These three \\ntreatment approaches were intensive lowering of blood sugar levels compared with a more standard blood \\nsugar treatment; intensive lowering of blood pressure compared with standard blood pressure treatment; and \\ntreatment of multiple blood lipids with two drugs—a fibrate plus a statin —compared with one drug, a statin \\nalone.201 \\nThe study began enrolling participants in 2001 and took place in 77 clinical sites across the United States and \\nCanada. A total of 10,251 adults with established Type 2 diabetes participated in ACCORD. At enrollment, \\nstudy participants were between age 40 and 79 (average age 62), had diabetes for an average of 10 years, and \\nwere at especially high risk for CVD events because they already had pre-existing CVD, evidence of \\nsubclinical CVD, or at least two CVD risk factors in addition to Type 2 diabetes. The other CVD risk factors \\ncould be high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, or obesity.  \\nThe primary outcome measure for all three trials was the first occurrence after randomization of a major \\nCVD event, specifically nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death. Secondary outcomes include \\ntotal mortality (death), microvascular outcomes (e.g., eye, kidney, and nerve complications), health -related \\nquality of life, and cost-effectiveness. \\nAll three ACCORD clinical trials have ended. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) \\nstopped the intensive blood sugar lowering strategy in 2008 due to safety concerns. Participants in the \\nintensive blood sugar treatment strategy group were transitioned to the standard treatment strategy. The blood \\npressure and lipid treatment trials continued until the planned end of the study in 2009. In its regular review \\nof the available study data, the ACCORD Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) noticed an une xpected \\nincrease in total deaths from any cause among participants who had been randomly (by chance) assigned to \\nthe intensive lowering of blood sugar levels group compared with those assigned to the standard blood sugar \\ntreatment group. The data analyses showed that over an average of 3.5 years of treatment (ranging from \\nabout 2 years to about 7 years), 257 participants in the intensive group died compared with 203 in the \\nstandard group—a difference of 54 deaths, or an excess of about 3 deaths per 1,000 pa rticipants treated for a \\nyear. This translates to a statistically significant 22% higher rate of death in the intensive group than in the \\nstandard group.  \\nThere was a trend toward lower (10% lower) rate of primary outcome events, primarily nonfatal heart \\nattacks, in the intensive group compared with the standard treatment group. However, the DSMB \\nrecommended discontinuing intensive blood sugar treatment because the harm of the intensive strategy \\noutweighed the potential benefit. The NHLBI accepted the DSMB’s recommendation and decided to \\ntransition all participants to the standard blood sugar strategy. \\nThe results of the blood sugar trial were published in 2008.202 There was no significant difference in the \\nprimary study outcome between the intensive and standard blood pressure treatment groups. The primary \\noutcome was the time to first occurrence after randomization of a heart attack, a stroke, or a cardiovascular \\ndeath. Thus, the primary hypothesis of the ACCORD BP trial was not supported. There was, however, a \\nsignificant reduction in the rate of strokes, although the numbers were relatively small. This reduction in \\nstroke was consistent with previous blood pressure lowering trials. Overall, however, the findings from the \\nACCORD blood pressure trial suggest that, on average, the standard treatment for lowering blood pressure \\nwas just as good as the intensive lowering treatment for cardiovascular outcomes.  \\nThe results of the lipid203 and the blood pressure204 trials were published in 2010. Overall, the fibrate and the \\nplacebo groups did not differ in the rates of the combined outcome of heart attacks, strokes, or cardiovascular \\ndeath. The results, however, suggest that men may benefit from this treatment, but there was a trend towar d \\nmore cardiovascular problems in women receiving the combination therapy compared with those who \\nreceived statins only. Also, the group of patients who at the start of the trial had the lowest level of HDL \\ncholesterol combined with the highest level of triglycerides (which represented only 17% of the ACCORD \\nparticipants) may have benefitted from this combined drug treatment.'),\n",

      "A fundamental question, my friend. As Dr. John Snow, I'm happy to explain. Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels. It's a condition where the body is unable to produce enough insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels, or is unable to effectively use the insulin it produces.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several types of diabetes, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Type 1 diabetes**: An autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, resulting in a lack of insulin production.\n",
      "2. **Type 2 diabetes**: A condition where the body becomes resistant to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells, and the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs.\n",
      "3. **Gestational diabetes**: A type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, usually in the second or third trimester, due to hormonal changes and insulin resistance.\n",
      "4. **Prediabetes**: A condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diabetes can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Increased thirst and urination\n",
      "* Fatigue\n",
      "* Blurred vision\n",
      "* Slow healing of cuts and wounds\n",
      "* Tingling or numbness in the hands and feet\n",
      "\n",
      "If left untreated or poorly managed, diabetes can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and, as we've been discussing, diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I must say, it's essential to manage diabetes through a combination of lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, and, if necessary, medication to control blood sugar levels and prevent complications.\n"
